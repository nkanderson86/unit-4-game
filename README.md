# Mystery Gems 

Description:
I used a combination of javascript, jquery, html & css to create a simple guessing game.  For this game I was able to set my game up as an object and put all my game logic in methods within that object.  I set up on click events to call those methods and hide elements. Once started, the game can continue to run without refresh after the game is called. 

Pain Points:
The hardest part for me was just getting started.  Just like the last assignment, I had a hard time taking pseudocode and turning it into chunks that I could bite off and work on.  Shout out to Emile for helping me lay out the skeleton of my object.  Once I got started, it became much easier the more I coded. 

If I had more time... 
-Adding jQuery effects to my onclick events (I couldn't figure that out)
-Stop using alert() for my win/loss messages.  I'd definitely prefer to use something like a bootstrap toast or modal
- Disable my gem buttons until the game starts, I don't think this would be that hard to implement but didn't have the time.
- Figure out how to get that little white outline around my buttons to disappear

Wins: 
I was definitely stoked to get everything set up in an object.  The previous project I attempted with just functions and variables and struggled mighitily so the idea of an object was daunting.  I feel way more comfortable with DOM manipulation, objects, and call back functions.
